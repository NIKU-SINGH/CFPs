## Introduction

Open Source thrives on the strength of its community. Many significant FOSS projects owe their success to dedicated contributors.

## The Current Challenge

Unfortunately, many open source projects have overlooked the importance of improving the onboarding process and creating a user-friendly experience for new contributors. Consequently, these projects suffer from a lack of contributions, reduced visibility, and potential decline.

As core contributors progress, they may lose touch with the newcomer's perspective. This leads to onboarding processes lacking essential information, making it challenging for new contributors to understand and engage effectively.

## Understanding the High Drop-Out Rates

Several factors contribute to the high drop-out rates among new contributors:

1. **Overwhelming for Beginners:** The open source environment can be overwhelming for those just starting.

2. **Lack of Clarity:** New contributors often struggle to understand where their contributions fit into the project and the impact they can make.

3. **Absence of Appreciation:** Many newcomers don't receive the recognition they deserve for their efforts.

4. **Community Support:** The absence of proper guidance and mentorship from the community can be discouraging.

5. **Absence of a Clear Roadmap:** Contributors may find it challenging to navigate the project's development without a clear roadmap.

## Potential Solutions

To address these challenges, a standardized approach that considers the perspective of beginners is crucial. Here are steps to make a difference:

## Adopting a Common Standard

1. **Streamline the Onboarding Process:** Ensure the onboarding process is smooth and provides newcomers with an overview of the project.

2. **Quantify Contributions:** Give visibility to every contribution, making sure each one is acknowledged and appreciated.

3. **Recognize and Encourage:** Appreciate and encourage the efforts of new contributors to foster a sense of belonging.

4. **Community Support and Mentorship:** Offer proper support and mentorship to guide newcomers through their journey.

5. **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Develop comprehensive tutorials and step-by-step guides to ease the contribution process for beginners.

By adopting these practices, open source projects can create an inclusive, welcoming, and sustainable community that benefits both new and experienced contributors alike.
